# user-experience

### Ideal User
- The ideal user can be anyone who knows how to cook and enjoys cooking. 
- This can be ideal tool for someone who like try new favourite recipes and wants it easy to reach.
- Can be espesially interesting for people with strict diet plans, such as vegeterians, vegans, pescaterians etc. This is because people can add their favorite recipes and can always get an access to them as soon as they have an internet.
- It can be also interesting to those who like to share some great recipies with others.


### What users can expect

- Users can expect intuative navigation
- Visual design that can be easy to read and work with
- Great recipies that recommended and published by other users.
- Many new recipies that people share and constantly update.
- Can share own recipe with other people.
- Virtual space to keep own recipies always accessable.


### As developers, I'd expect

- The website works fast and smooth on different screens, phones, tablets, laptops and provides to our clients positive experience when they interact with our website.
- More users start to use the site.
- User protection and security. Users that visit the site feel secured.
- Site meets users expectation.
- Users can easily to add their recipies and others can read it. 
- User that added recipe can easily edit or delete it if needed.

# planning

### Colour palette

- In the project were used mainly 5 colours : Burgundi, Dark Green, Dark Olive, Pink and Gray color.

To make design user friendly and easy for eyes I followed in my work these 5 colors.

### Canban Board
- In my work I used Agile Approach, which means that I updated some aspects and ideas while I was working on the project. This brough to me quite interesting experience, 
as from the beginning I wanted to include in my project much more futures and options such as creating more various pages, make page for users where they could keep favourite recipies, comment recipies of other people and give likes. Nevertheless, when I strted my project I felt massive lack of time for adding those futures to my projects, and canban helped me quite fast to realise that I won't be able to add so many futures in my project so I followed the simple model. 

# feautures

### Existing Features

The web page has a simple and intuitive design. On top of the page user sees the Title of the project - Recipe Book. On the right hand side user has a navigation panel.
Navigation panel allows user to navigate through the project and pick options such as: Home, About, New Recipe, Register and Login.
After user registered or logged in, option LOGOUT replaces login and register options.
Furthermore, users who didn't login can't add new recipe.
After adding a recipe, admin will be needed to approve it before it published.

### Future improvements left to implement

- The current project requires more options to be added.
- To make this project even more interesting, I would add option to comment recipies and give them likes.This would allow users interact with other users.
- I would include option to check recipies and approve it in future for admin.
- I would also create a new page Favourites, this would be a page where user can save his favourite recipies in alpabetic order.

# Code

This is my first project on Django. It feelt very challenging and has a lot of options and allows to build quite progessional websites. Combining Django with other apps brings allows to reach unbelievable results. I learbed that Bootstrap, Crispyforms, Summernote, SQL, Cloudinary and other additions - can add project very interesting futures. Nevertheless, I would say this is also quite complicated project was for me and I feel that If I had more time and opportunities to dive deeper it might allow me to create things that I can't even imagine today. Options are limitless. I hope in future I will have a chance to worl and learn more about it.
