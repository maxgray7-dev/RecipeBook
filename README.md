# user-experience

### Ideal User
- The ideal user can be anyone who knows how to cook and enjoys cooking. 
- This can be ideal tool for someone who like try new favourite recipes and wants it easy to reach.
- Can be espesially interesting for people with strict diet plans, such as vegeterians, vegans, pescaterians etc. This is because people can add their favorite recipes and can always get an access to them as soon as they have an internet.
- It can be also interesting to those who like to share some great recipies with others.


### What users can expect

- Users can expect intuative navigation
- Visual design that can be easy to read and work with
- Great recipies that recommended and published by other users.
- Many new recipies that people share and constantly update.
- Can share own recipe with other people.
- Virtual space to keep own recipies always accessable.


### As developers, I'd expect

- The website works fast and smooth on different screens, phones, tablets, laptops and provides to our clients positive experience when they interact with our website.
- More users start to use the site.
- User protection and security. Users that visit the site feel secured.
- Site meets users expectation.
- Users can easily to add their recipies and others can read it. 
- User that added recipe can easily edit or delete it if needed.

# planning

### Colour palette

- In the project were used mainly 5 colours : Burgundi, Dark Green, Dark Olive, Pink and Gray color.

To make design more user friendly and easy for eyes I picked followed in my work these 5 colors.

### Canban Board
- In my work I used Agile Approach, which means that I updated some aspects and ideas while I was working on the project. This brough to me quite interesting experience, 
as from the beginning I wanted to include in my project much more futures and options such as creating more various pages, make page for users where they could keep favourite recipies, comment recipies of other people and give likes. Nevertheless, when I strted my project I felt massive lack of time for adding those futures to my projects, and canban helped me quite fast to realise that I won't be able to add so many futures in my project so I followed the simple model. 

# feautures

### Existing Features

The web page has a simple and intuitive design. On top of the page User sees the Title of the project - Recipe Book. On the right hand side user has a navigation panel.
Navigation panel allows user to navigate through the project and pick options such as: Home Page, Add New Recipe, Read ABOUT project, login or register.
After user registered or logged in, navbar hides button register and loginm replacing it on logout.
Furthermore, user who logged in can add new recipe to the site so other users can see the recipe but they can't edit this recipe if they are not author of the recipe.

### Future improvements left to implement

- The current project has other options tor development.
- It could be an interestin idea to add orher pages with simple and easy games.
- I would like to add more animation to the page if I would have more time.

# Code

This was my first experience of coding in JavaScript on my own. I found this project quite interesting but challenging. It required a lot of information to re-read, re-watch, and to be practiced before implemented. This project required from me to search for additional sources, codes and and rewatch some videos for multiple times.
I know now the principle but I have to practice much more and continue learning.

# Acknowledgement

In this chapter I would like to express my gratitude to Code Institute for providing essentialand detailed information about JavaScript materials. It was very helpful when I could learn and peactice. Also, Thank you very much Stefania Frustagli who inspired me and supported me during the time I was writing the code.
